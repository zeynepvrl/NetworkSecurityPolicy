    <h1 id="network-security-policy">Network Security Policy</h1>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>This Network Security Policy has been created to ensure the security of the IT infrastructure and protect the information assets of the organization. This policy provides a framework for determining the organization's security requirements, preventing unauthorized access to the network, meeting appropriate regulatory requirements, and ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.</p>
<h3 id="11-purpose">1.1 Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this policy covers the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Protection Policy: To protect the organization's sensitive information and take precautions against unauthorized access.</li>
<li>Access Control: Ağa erişimi kontrol etmek ve yetkilendirme süreçlerini belirlemek.</li>
<li>Incident Response Policy: Identifying and managing processes for responding to security breaches and incidents.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="2-data-protection-policy">2. Data Protection Policy</h2>
<p>Guidelines for Security and Protection of Sensitive Information:</p>
<h3 id="21-encryption">2.1 Encryption</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sensitive data must be encrypted, both during transmission and at rest, using industry-standard encryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). Encryption should be mandatory across all communication channels (email, messaging platforms, file transfers, etc.) to prevent unauthorized access or interception of sensitive information.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="22-access-control">2.2 Access Control</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Access to sensitive data should be strictly controlled and given only to authorities when needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User authentication mechanisms such as strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), or biometric authentication should be implemented. Thus, only authorized personnel should have access to sensitive data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By using role-based access control (RBAC), users' privileges should be limited and individuals should only be able to access the data and systems they need for their job.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="23-data-classification">2.3 Data Classification</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A data classification policy should be established that allows data to be classified based on sensitivity levels (public, internal, confidential, highly confidential, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appropriate access controls and encryption methods should be assigned based on data classification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data classes should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the Company's data landscape and regulatory requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="24-data-loss-prevention-dlp">2.4 Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DLP solutions must be deployed to prevent unauthorized transmission or leakage of sensitive data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DLP systems must be configured to detect and block the transmission of sensitive information via email, web applications, portable storage devices, and other communication channels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="25-data-storage-and-destruction">2.5 Data Storage and Destruction</h3>
<h4 id="251-data-storage">2.5.1 Data Storage</h4>
<p><strong>Determination of Retention Period:</strong> Appropriate retention periods are determined for each data type. These periods must comply with both regulatory requirements and the Company's business needs. The storage period is determined according to the specified classification of the data.</p>
<p><strong>Secure Storage:</strong> Data to be stored must be stored securely. Access control and monitoring mechanisms should be established for data stored in physical environments. In electronic media, data should be encrypted and accessible by authorized users.</p>
<p><strong>Regular Review:</strong> The data retention policy and retention periods should be reviewed regularly. Necessary updates should be made in line with changing regulatory requirements and business needs.</p>
<h4 id="252-data-destruction">2.5.2 Data Destruction</h4>
<p><strong>Destruction Procedures:</strong> The data destruction process is initiated when the specified retention periods expire. Procedures are defined to securely delete or destroy data. These procedures may include physical destruction of data storage devices or permanent digital deletion of data.</p>
<p><strong>Destruction Responsibilities:</strong> Individuals and departments responsible for the destruction process are determined. These persons are obliged to correctly implement data destruction procedures and record destruction processes.</p>
<p><strong>Record Keeping:</strong> Destruction procedures should be recorded in detail. These records must contain information indicating what data was destroyed, when and how. This is necessary for audit purposes and provides traceability.</p>
<p><strong>Training and Awareness:</strong> Personnel involved in the disposal process must be trained to follow the correct procedures. Additionally, all employees must be informed of the data destruction policy and cooperate when necessary.</p>
<h4 id="253-audit-and-compliance">2.5.3 Audit and Compliance</h4>
<p><strong>Audits:</strong> Data storage and destruction processes should be audited regularly. These audits are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of processes and check their compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance:</strong> The policy must comply with relevant regulatory requirements and industry standards. The policy should be updated to take into account constantly changing regulations and industry standards.</p>
<h4 id="256-data-backup-and-recovery">2.5.6 Data Backup and Recovery</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regular data backup should be implemented to ensure the availability and integrity of critical information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backups should be stored securely in remote locations to prevent data loss due to hardware failure, natural disasters, or cyber attacks.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="33-monitoring-and-control">3.3 Monitoring and Control</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Network access activities should be regularly monitored and audited. Log files and network activity records should be examined and abnormal activities should be detected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User activities should be automatically recorded at the time of access to critical systems or sensitive data on the network. This helps detect and prevent potential threats early.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="34-mobile-and-remote-access-management">3.4 Mobile and Remote Access Management</h3>

<h2 id="10conclusion">10.Conclusion</h2>
<p>This Network Security Policy provides a comprehensive framework for protecting an organization's information assets and ensuring the security of its IT infrastructure. After providing an overview of the main objectives of the policy, it focuses on specific topics such as protection of sensitive information, access control, incident response, physical security, backup and recovery plans, network traffic monitoring and analysis, security of third-party service providers, and compliance policies. </p>
<p>In particular, it is important to use industry standard encryption algorithms such as AES to secure sensitive data, adopt strong authentication methods for access control, and use role-based access control. Additionally, data classification, using DLP solutions to prevent data loss, and streamlining data retention and destruction processes are also critical in protecting sensitive data. </p>
<p>In addition, issues such as selecting and installing the right tools for network traffic monitoring and analysis, establishing an incident response team to respond quickly to security incidents, and taking physical security measures should also be taken into account. </p>
<p>Finally, setting security standards and regularly reviewing and updating compliance policies in dealing with third-party service providers is important to minimize the organization's security vulnerabilities. </p>
